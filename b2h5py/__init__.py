"""Transparent optimized reading of n-dimensional Blosc2 slices for h5py.

Optimizations are applied to slices of the form ``dataset[...]`` or
``dataset.__getitem__(...)`` with step 1 on Blosc2-compressed datasets using
the native byte order.

They are enabled automatically on module import, by monkey-patching the
``h5py.Dataset`` class.  You may explicitly undo this patching with
`unpatch_dataset_class()` and redo it with `patch_dataset_class()`.

You may force-disable the optimization at any time by setting
``BLOSC2_FILTER=1`` in the environment.
